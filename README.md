# Virgil

A library to make building parsers and lexers easier.


## Description

Heavily based on [Canto 34](https://github.com/stevecooperorg/canto34) by [Steve Cooper](http://www.stevecooper.org). I've used it plenty for my own projects but kept finding there were a few more things I was always adding, so decided to spin off my own version.
